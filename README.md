# WeFit Challenge - React + TypeScript + styled-components

## Description
The challenge consists of creating a simplified e-commerce website from scratch, where the candidate will have to create a flow with three modules/screens.

Are they:
- **Home:** Where he will have to make a request to the API, thus bringing the list of films that can be added to the cart;
- **Affection:** Where he can see the items that have been added, adding up the total value based on each item added, and being able to remove an item from the cart. By default, if the cart has no items added, the empty screen should appear with the option to return to the home screen;
- **Purchase made:** After confirming the order on the previous screen, the user should be redirected to the confirmed order screen. Here the user will also have the option to return to the home screen;
